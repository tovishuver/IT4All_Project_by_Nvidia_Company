The project's idea was to familiarize and delve deeper into the concepts of communication between networks and to become more proficient in the Python programming language.

In this project, I undertook the development of an application designed to assist technicians in gaining clear insights into the communications occurring between computers.
The application achieves this by extracting data from the pcap files provided by the technician. 
The program encompasses comprehensive authorization and authentication processes.

Ultimately, the technicians benefit from my application by receiving a graph that effectively visualizes the communications present within the pcap file, 
enhancing their understanding and analysis of the data.

Here is an example of the final graph generated from a sample pcap file:
